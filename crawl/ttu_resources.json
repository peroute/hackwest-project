The MINDSPA provides Texas Tech enrolled students, faculty, and staff a space for\n                           deliberate and intentional relaxation and stress management. Equipped with many features\n                           and tools to help you relax your body and calm your mind. The MINDSPA provides a comfortable and private space for stress reducing activities,\n                           that isn\u2019t always easy to find on a busy campus.  Stress is a physiological response to anything our bodies or minds perceive as a threat,\n                           and often that physiological response leads to tension in our muscles. Massage, stretching,\n                           and exercise can help relieve muscle tension caused by stress that we may not be aware\n                           of day-to-day. \u00a0  New with the Fall 2022 Semester. Virtual reality offers immediate access to a whole\n                           world of experiences. The MINDSPA has VR hardware available for students to use as\n                           a part of their MINDSPA session. You can use VR to explore a tropical rain forest\n                           or beach halfway across the globe, immerse yourself in a meditation exercise, simulate\n                           relaxing activities like fishing or tai chi, let your mind focus on a 3D puzzle, or\n                           find ways new ways to express your creativity!\u00a0 Virtual Reality headset and controllers must be requested from the front office when\n                           arriving for a MINDSPA appointment. The stress management audio-video library contains recordings for yoga nidra, breathing\n                           exercises, guided imagery, affirmations, and meditation. The library also includes\n                           relaxing music and sounds such as singing bowls, ocean waves, and rain.\u00a0  The MINDSPA has plenty of space to roll out a yoga mat and practice moving meditation,\n                           gentle physical exercise, or somatic mind-body exercises. You can follow a video guide\n                           from one of our mind-body exercise DVDs, use the computer to find a guided exercise\n                           online, or practice independently.\u00a0 The Zafu and Sabuton sets available are cushions that allow for comfortable sitting\n                           positions for sitting meditation and reflection.\u00a0  Equipped with sensors that read bio-metric data such as respiration and heart rate,\n                           the MINDSPA offers software that coaches stress reduction strategies while seeing\n                           the real-time impact on your physiology.\u00a0  Mindfulness exercises led by Student Counseling Center therapists are available in\n                           the audio-visual library, on our website, and by scanning the QR code located on the\n                           themed posters in the MINDSPA.

Mentor Tech mentors are faculty, staff, upper-level students, or alumni who care deeply\n                                    about supporting Red Raiders through their first year. You don\u2019t have to be perfect or have all the answers. If you\u2019ve ever faced a challenge,\n                                    figured out how to ask for help, or learned something the hard way\u2014you\u2019ve got what\n                                    it takes to be a mentor.

We keep it simple so you can focus on\n                                    the relationship, not the logistics. As a mentor, you\u2019ll: *Faculty/Staff Mentors: Please complete required Raider Success Hub training and remain\n                                    FERPA-compliant.

How does the matching process work?When you sign up, we\u2019ll ask about your background, interests, availability, and preferences.\n                                    Based on that, we\u2019ll match you with a first-year student who\u2019s looking for support,\n                                    connection, and guidance.Our goal is to create matches that feel natural and helpful, and if anything isn\u2019t\n                                    working\u2014we\u2019ll help with a rematch.

Most mentors spend less than 2 hours per month. Can I mentor more than one student?Yes! If you\u2019re open to it, you can let us know you\u2019re available to support more than\n                                    one mentee.

      "text": "\u00a0 In group therapy, people learn to catch themselves making the same old mistakes, try\n                                 out new approaches to problems, get support from other members, and get challenged\n                                 in a variety of ways. A group has one or two leaders who may facilitate interactions\n                                 in the group, challenge members to look at these interactions in a different way,\n                                 and offer feedback and support. Group members are actively involved, and are expected\n                                 to share their feelings and impressions to the extent to which they are comfortable.\n                                 The information discussed in group is confidential and group members agree to make\n                                 a commitment to that confidentiality before participating in the groups. You alone decide what to say and what not to say in group. It takes time for a group\n                                    of people to develop into a relationship. It is also normal to feel some anxiety about\n                                    talking in a group. Pace yourself. Disclose what you are ready to disclose. Like most\n                                    other things in life, however, you tend to get out of group what you put into it.\n                                    If you make an effort to talk about what brought you to counseling in the first place,\n                                    we are confident that you will have a positive experience. Along with the right not to discuss what you're not ready to talk about comes the\n                                    responsibility to initiate your own participation. It is each group member's responsibility\n                                    to tell the group what you need, provide feedback in a warm manner, share reactions\n                                    to other members, and express your present emotions. Group leaders are not mind readers,\n                                    and do not know when you want to say something. We also don't have all the answers,\n                                    though we certainly often wish we did! Don't forget that the other members of the\n                                    group may be another good resource for challenge, support, or suggestions. This may be the biggest myth about group therapy! In fact, research shows that group\n                                    participants usually experience equally satisfactory results as those who receive\n                                    individual counseling. Sometimes they even like it better! At our Counseling Center,\n                                    we use group, individual, and couple counseling based on the students' needs, not\n                                    on how busy our schedules are. Guidelines about how to participate in the group help keep the group a safe place\n                              for you and everyone else. If you join a group here, we ask that you comply with the\n                              following rules. Additional guidelines might be established by the group itself to promote a feeling\n                              of safety for group members. Other guidelines might be outlined by your group facilitators\n                              depending on the nature, size, and purpose of the different groups. You will be informed\n                              of these guidelines if they exist.

TTU is known for its supportive and rigorous programs and has\n                        one of the largest groups of CMFT faculty in the country. Our graduates have found\n                        success in a wide variety of academic, clinical, and other settings. The in-person/on-campus\n                        CMFT graduate programs include a doctoral and a master's program. The TTU CMFT programs\n                        are not offered online or in hybrid formats.\u00a0 The CMFT doctoral program has a long and distinguished history of preparing students\n                        for contributions in academics, administration and clinical work. There is a strong\n                        emphasis on training in research methodology as well as theoretical and clinical sophistication.\n                        Many of TTU's doctoral graduates can be found in academic institutions around the\n                        country. The doctoral program has been accredited by the Commission on Accreditation\n                        for Couple, Marriage, and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE) since 1981. Click here\n                        for the doctoral program mission statement. The master's program at TTU is a clinically-focused program grounded in relational/systemic\n                        theories of practice.

Student Disability Services (SDS) staff provide\n                              a variety of accommodations and services for individuals with disabilities. Accommodations\n                              are tailored to the individual and the disability. With over 2,000 students registered for services, we encourage students to overcome\n                              challenges and attain personal and academic success while the SDS staff functions as a student advocate. Through active involvement with all areas\n                              of the University, SDS is able to monitor conditions relevant to students with disabilities and offer support\n                              in decisions affecting their quality of life. In addition to the services offered by our main Student Disability Services office,\n                              SDS also offers a supplemental academic enhancement program for students with Learning\n                              Disabilities and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders, the TECHniques Center. The TECHniques Center is a fee-for-service program that provides one-on-one, regularly\n                              scheduled content and study skills tutoring, as well as weekly meetings with an academic\n                              counselor.  Student Disability Services promotes each student's learning experience by providing\n                              programs and services for students with disabilities and education of the campus community\n                              on issues related to students' disabilities.
